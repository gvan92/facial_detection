# facial_recognition
Using OpenCV to detect and recognize my face

This project attempts to train a model for facial detection and recognition. To train the data, I created folders that each contained 10 headshot photos of a person. I created data for three different people which are myself, Simu Liu and Andrew Ng. I decided to use other Asian males in the dataset to see how well the model will perform. However, the program can be used for a larger set of people.
